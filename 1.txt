struct a java web framework based on mvc now 
java jsf and ajax why 

AJAX just uses a combination of:
A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)

The XMLHttpRequest Object
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server.

The XMLHttpRequest object is a developers dream, because you can:

Update a web page without reloading the page
Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
Receive data from a server  - after the page has loaded
Send data to a server - in the background

var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
       // Typical action to be performed when the document is ready:
       document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = xhttp.responseText;
    }
};
xhttp.open("GET", "filename", true);
xhttp.send();

Key Differences:
| Feature | fetch | XMLHttpRequest | 
| API Style | Modern, promise-based | Older, callback-based | 
| Syntax | Cleaner and more readable | Verbose and less intuitive | 
| Streaming | Supports streaming responses | Buffers entire response | 
| CORS Handling | More flexible with mode options | Requires manual setup | 
| Request/Response Handling | Uses Request and Response objects | Uses event-based model | 
| Progress Events | Not supported (yet) | Supported (e.g., onprogress) | 
| Timeouts | Requires AbortController | Built-in timeout property | 
| Browser Support | Modern browsers only | Supported in all browsers |
